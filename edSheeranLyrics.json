I was confused about\nShe should figure it out while I\u2019m sat here singing\nAh-la-la-la-la\nDon\u2019t fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my arm\nI don\u2019t wanna know that babe\nAh-la-la-la-la\nDon\u2019t fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don\u2019t wanna know that babe\nAh-la-la-la-la\n*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door\nI don\u2019t even know if she knows what for\nShe was crying on my shoulder\nI already told ya\nTrust and respect is what we do this for\nI never intended to be next\nBut you didn\u2019t need to take him to bed that\u2019s all\nAnd I never saw him as a threat\nUntil you disappeared with him to have sex of course\nIt\u2019s not like we were both on tour\nWe were staying on the same fucking hotel floor\nAnd I wasn\u2019t looking for a promise or commitment\nBut it was never just fun and I thought you were different\nThis is not the way you realize what you wanted\nIt\u2019s a bit too much, too late if I\u2019m honest\nAll this time God knows I\u2019m singing\nAh-la-la-la-la\nDon\u2019t fuck with my love\nThat heart is so cold\nAll over my arm\nI don\u2019t wanna know that babe\nAh-la-la-la-la\nDon\u2019t fuck with my love\nI told her she knows\nTake aim and reload\nI don\u2019t wanna know that babe\nAh-la-la-la-la",

        "lyrics": "I was born inside a small town, I've lost that state of mind\nLearned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine\nI forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride\nThe paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind\nSo blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life\nFriends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride\nAnd when the world's against me is when I really come alive\nAnd everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride\nYou know that I've got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs\nI think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun\nI need to get in the right mind and clear myself up\nInstead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become\nI guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me\nWithout a nine-to-five job or an uni degree\nTo be caught up in the trappings of the industry\nThey showed me the locked doors I find another use of key\nAnd you'll see\n\nI'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\n\nI used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs\nI chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong\nI think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell\nRelationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well\nAnd ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps\nBecause you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun\nPlease know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run\nI beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become\nOur conversations with my father on the A14\nAge twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams\nNow I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me\nWith my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans\nWembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou\nI may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud\nAnd to the next generation, inspiration's allowed\nThe world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now\nSomehow\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am not beyond my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain\nEraser\n\nI woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror\nThinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner\nThe industry told me to look like them\nBut I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner\nI wish that she could have been my first time\nAnd I wish that I'd never took that first line\nAnd I wish that every word in this verse rhymed\nBut forgive me if it doesn't\nI wish that I could make peace with my older cousin\nI wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't\nI wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'\nAnd the taste stays underneath my tongue\nWish that I had known what to do as a youngling\nWish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party\nWith that hardly matters now, man, does it?\nWish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it\nI wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget\nBut while we're on the subject\nI wish my private life would have never gone public\nBut that's the sacrifice that we make\nSpendin' my whole time high livin' life away\n\nSingin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\nI'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\n\nI wish my family and friends they stay healthy\nI wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy\nI found myself late night wishin' on a star\nEveryday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh\nAnd I wish I'd never run to\nEvery woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to\nI wish I was the role model you looked up to\nIf I told my fans the things I did they'd say, \"Fuck you\"\nI wish I was home more\nI wish my teens could see the kids on the birthdays, but yo, we're on tour\nAnd I wish I'd grow more, wish I told more\nPeople that I love 'em but it's in the music that I'm known for\nAnd I wish he never got cancer\nAnd if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?\nOh yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressin' 'cause\nEvery day this shit gets the best of us\nUsin' my balance on eraser blades\nSpendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait\n\nSingin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\nI'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\n\nI'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat cold\nMum sayin', \"Don't smoke,\" no, I don't listen, I got\nLove for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast\nPeople that I don't know share the same vision\nI find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine\nTryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign\nSometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme\nStarin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryin' to find mine\nShit, quick before I hit it again\nSurrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men\nAnd who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen\nJust let me hit the studio when we can rip it again\nI'm a competitive dick, with an adrenaline kick\nMy daddy told me work hard and you can never be shit\nI've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad\nSet back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had\nOne wish",

get bitten,\nBecause plagiarism is hidden\nWhich I would sit on the rhythm,\nPrisoner with a vision\n\nSigned to a label, but didn't listen to any criticism\nThought you knew but you didn't\nSo perk your ears up and listen\nStudio with a system\nAnd you could say that I'm driven\nAnd now it's on to the next saga\nWe drink the best lager\nI never tried to win you\nOver like your stepfather\nI do my own thing now, and get respect after\nAnd I'm avoiding the cane like it was Get Carter\n\nFor four years I never had a place to stay\nBut it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight\nAt 16 years old I moved out of my home\nI was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and\nI choked\nAnd we've been sleeping at the subway station, sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population\nNot my imagination, I don't want to relax\nBut would it hurt your reputation,\nIf I put it on wax?\nI take it back now\n\n\n\n\n\n[chorus]\nCome on and take it back love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back love, oh\n\nTake it back with the rhythm and blues\nAnd my back pack I'll be singing the news,\nTrying to act like Jack Black when I bring him to school\nI'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop,\nBringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes,\nI give you the truth through the vocal booth,\nStars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit,\nThey try and take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot,\nBut then again that's what they're supposed to do,\nAnd I'm supposed to be calm,\nI tattooed the lyrics onto my arm, whispering everything that happens is from now on,\nI'll be ready to start it again at the end of the song,\nStill they claiming that I handled it wrong,\nBut then I never had an enemy, except for NME,\nBut I'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be,\nWith only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees,\nAre healthier than a dalmatian with pedigree\nSinging for the masses,\nRubber dinghy rapids,\nKeep this rapping a habit\nAnd keep on fashioning magic,\nI'm battling with respect,\nI don't know if I'll have it,\nThis songs from the heart,\nCovering the planet,\nI'll take it back now\n\n[chorus]\nCome on and take it back love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back love, oh\n\nTake it back now\nNow, I don't ever want to be perfect,\nCause I'm a singer that you\nNever want to see shirtless\nI accept the fact that someone's got to win the worst-dressed,\nTaking my first steps into the scene,\nGiving me focus\nPutting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton\nConsidering a name change,\nThinking it was hopeless\nRhyming over recordings\nAvoiding tradition\nCause every day some lyrics\nAnd a melody can be written\nNow absence can make your heart ache\nBut drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly,\nI need to let my liver be\nAnd I say it again,\nLiving life on the edge,\nWith a closed hand full of friends\nIs good advice from a man\nWho took his life on the road with me\nAnd I hope to see him blowing up globally\nCause that's how it's supposed to be\nI'm screaming out vocally\nMight seem totally impossible\nAchieving life's dreams\nBut, but I just write schemes\nI'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans\nMadison Square Garden is where I might be\nBut more likely,\nYou'll find me in the back\nRoom of a dive bar with my mates\nHaving a pint with McDaid\nDiscussing records we made\nAnd every single second knowing\nThat we'll never betray\nThe way we were raised\nRemembering our background\nSat down\nThat's how we plan it out;\nIt's time to take it back now\n\n[chorus]\nCome on and take it back love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back love, oh\n\nCome on and take it back love\nCome on and take it back for us\nDon't you fade into the back love, oh\n\nMy dreams keep me awake at night\nWritten in rhymes, and lies, deliver the hype\nAm I just living the lie\nWith this you must know that the number's just sold woah\nWill keep me going through the tough times, dream with me\nWe forget 90 per cent of it when we wake\nBut the other 10 per cent it never fades\nDreaming dreams, day to day goals\nStay awake loads, try to make the cut like the\nPaper or razor blade, oh, never give up\nAnd just remember just to hold out more\nA couple years ago\nI couldn't just control that thought\nYou'd find me buskin' on the street\nWhen it was cold outdoors\nAnd now I'm sweating on the stage\nOf a sold out tour\nWriting love songs for the sake of it\nNever to make a hit\nYou can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick\nI'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and\nMost of these other guys are kids that posties\nLittle sister has to babysit, that's just a way it is\nDreams are your own, just set your goals\nAnd have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path\nYou'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know\nWhere you will go or where you will be tomorrow",

        "lyrics": "Now I don't wanna hate you\nJust wish you'd never gone for the man\nAnd waited two weeks at least\nBefore you let him take you\nI stayed true\nI kind of knew you liked the dude from private school\nHe's waiting for the time to move\nI knew he had his eyes on you\nHe's not the right guy for you\nDon't hate me cause I write the truth\nNo I would never lie to you\nBut it was never fine to lose you\nAnd what a way to find out\nIt never came from my mouth\nYou never changed your mind\nBut you were just afraid to mind out\nBut f- it, I won't be changing the subject I love it\nI'll make your little secret public it's nothing\nI'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me\nTrapped and I'm lacking sleep\nFact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually\nYou're practically my family\nIf we married then I'll guess you'd have to be\nBut tragically our love just lost the will to live\nBut would I kill to give it one more shot\nI think not\n\n[Hook]\nI don't love you baby\nI don't need you baby\nI don't want you no\nAnymore\nI don't love you baby\nI don't need you baby\nI don't wanna love you no\nAnymore\n\nRecently I tend to zone out\nUp in my headphones to Holocene\nYou promised your body but I'm away so much\nI stay more celibate than in a monastery\nI'm not cut out for life on the road\nCause I didn't know I'd miss you this much\nAnd at the time we'd just go, so sue me\nI guess I'm not the man that you need\nEver since you went to uni\nI've been sofa surfing with a rucksack\nFull of less cash and I guess that could get bad\nBut when I broke the industry\nThat's when I broke your heart\nI was supposed to chart and celebrate\nBut good things are over fast\nI know it's hard to deal with and see this\nI tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features\nThen I turn the music off\nAnd all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus\nI never really want to believe this\nGot advice from my dad and he\nTold me that family is all I'll ever have and need\nI guess I'm unaware of it\nSuccess is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't love you baby\nI don't need you baby\nI don't want you no\nAnymore\nI don't love you baby\nI don't need you baby\nI don't wanna love you no\nAnymore\n\nAnd since you left, I've given up my days off\nIt's what I need to stay strong\nI know you have a day job but mine is 24/7\nI feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook\nCause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could\nThe irony is if my career and music didn't exist\nIn 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid\nI'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink\nAnd lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's\nJust hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill\nAnd I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill\nGo down in history as just a wasted talent\nCan I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing?\nIt's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me\nEventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be\nEither way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this\nThese things happen for a reason and you can't change shit\nTake my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty\nBut I had to get this off my chest\n\nI don't love you baby\nI don't need you baby\nI don't want you no\nAnymore\nI don't love you baby\nI don't need you baby\nI don't wanna love you no\nAnymore",
